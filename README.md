# Pixel Art Board

## Instructions
First, enter a background color, and second enter a foreground color. Then the pixel art board will appear. It is broken into 36 sections in a 6 by 6 grid. For each section, enter a 0 if you want it to be the foreground color and a 1 if you want it to be the background color. Please only enter 1s and 0s. The sections go across, then down to the next line. See some examples below.

## Usage
I would recommend running this on [Replit](https://replit.com/), as that is how I have been doing it. Just copy and paste the code from [mainCode.py](mainCode.py) into a new project and hit run!
