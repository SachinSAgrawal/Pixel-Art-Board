# Pixel Art Board

## About
Paint a simple picture on a pixel art board using turtle graphics! The board is a 6x6 grid, and each section of the grid can stay as the background color or be set as the foreground color using binary encodings. If you like this project, I would appreciate if you starred it or even shared it with your friends.

## Instructions
* Enter a background and foreground color to make the pixel art board appear.
* An outline around the actual gridboard will be drawn.*
* It is a 6 by 6 grid, resulting in 36 total sections that can be filled in.
* For each section, enter a 1 if you want it to be the foreground color and a 0 if you want it to be the background color. 
* The sections go across, then down to the next line. 
* The turtle will be in the center of the section in question to help visualize your place.*
* See some examples below.

*Denotes a recently added feature.

2. Navigate to the directory in Terminal that contains all the files. 
3. Run `python3 mainCode.py` to start and follow the instructions above.

#### Prerequisites
Hopefully this goes without saying, but you need Python 3.x installed.

#### Notes
This can also be pretty easily run on [Replit](https://replit.com/) if you copy and paste all the associated files into a new project.
